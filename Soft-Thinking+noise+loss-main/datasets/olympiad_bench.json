                "value": "In each town in ARMLandia, the residents have formed groups, which meet each week to share math problems and enjoy each others' company over a potluck-style dinner. Each town resident belongs to exactly one group. Every week, each resident is required to make one dish and to bring it to his/her group.\n\nIt so happens that each resident knows how to make precisely two dishes. Moreover, no two residents of a town know how to make the same pair of dishes. Shown below are two example towns. In the left column are the names of the town's residents. Adjacent to each name is the list of dishes that the corresponding resident knows how to make.\n\n| ARMLton |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Paul | pie, turkey |\n| Arnold | pie, salad |\n| Kelly | salad, broth |\n\n\n| ARMLville |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Sally | steak, calzones |\n| Ross | calzones, pancakes |\n| David | steak, pancakes |\n\nThe population of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{pop}(T)$, is the number of residents of $T$. Formally, the town itself is simply the set of its residents, denoted by $\\left\\{r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{\\mathrm{pop}(T)}\\right\\}$ unless otherwise specified. The set of dishes that the residents of $T$ collectively know how to make is denoted $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$. For example, in the town of ARMLton described above, pop(ARMLton) $=3$, and dish(ARMLton) $=$ \\{pie, turkey, salad, broth\\}.\n\nA town $T$ is called full if for every pair of dishes in $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$, there is exactly one resident in $T$ who knows how to make those two dishes. In the examples above, ARMLville is a full town, but ARMLton is not, because (for example) nobody in ARMLton knows how to make both turkey and salad.\n\nDenote by $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$ a full town in which collectively the residents know how to make $d$ dishes. That is, $\\left|\\operatorname{dish}\\left(\\mathcal{F}_{d}\\right)\\right|=d$.\n\nIn order to avoid the embarrassing situation where two people bring the same dish to a group dinner, if two people know how to make a common dish, they are forbidden from participating in the same group meeting. Formally, a group assignment on $T$ is a function $f: T \\rightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots, k\\}$, satisfying the condition that if $f\\left(r_{i}\\right)=f\\left(r_{j}\\right)$ for $i \\neq j$, then $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}$ do not know any of the same recipes. The group number of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{gr}(T)$, is the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a group assignment on $T$.\n\nFor example, consider once again the town of ARMLton. A valid group assignment would be $f($ Paul $)=f($ Kelly $)=1$ and $f($ Arnold $)=2$. The function which gives the value 1 to each resident of ARMLton is not a group assignment, because Paul and Arnold must be assigned to different groups.\n\n\nFor a dish $D$, a resident is called a $D$-chef if he or she knows how to make the dish $D$. Define $\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)$ to be the set of residents in $T$ who are $D$-chefs. For example, in ARMLville, David is a steak-chef and a pancakes-chef. Further, $\\operatorname{chef}_{\\text {ARMLville }}($ steak $)=\\{$ Sally, David $\\}$.\n\n\nIf $\\operatorname{gr}(T)=\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for some $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called homogeneous. If $\\operatorname{gr}(T)>\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for each dish $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called heterogeneous. For example, ARMLton is homogeneous, because $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLton $)=2$ and exactly two chefs make pie, but ARMLville is heterogeneous, because even though each dish is only cooked by two chefs, $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLville $)=3$.\n\n\nA resident cycle is a sequence of distinct residents $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{n}$ such that for each $1 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, the residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ know how to make a common dish, residents $r_{n}$ and $r_{1}$ know how to make a common dish, and no other pair of residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}, 1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$ know how to make a common dish. Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise. For example, if $r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4}$ is a resident cycle, then $r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}, r_{3}$ and $r_{3}, r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}$ are indistinguishable resident cycles.\nIn terms of $k$ and $d$, find the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length $k$ in $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$."

For example, the family in house number 17 moves to house number 35.\nRoss takes a walk starting at his house, which is number 34 . He first visits house $n_{1}$, such that $d\\left(n_{1}, 34\\right)=1 / 3$. He then goes to another house, $n_{2}$, such that $d\\left(n_{1}, n_{2}\\right)=1 / 3$. Continuing in that way, he visits houses $n_{3}, n_{4}, \\ldots$, and each time, $d\\left(n_{i}, n_{i+1}\\right)=1 / 3$. At the end of the day, what is his maximum possible distance from his original house? Justify your answer."

For a fixed positive integer $p$, where $p \\leq n$, consider consecutive blocks of $p$ numbers in an $n$-label. For example, when $p=3$ and $L=263415$, the blocks are 263,634,341, and 415. We can associate to each of these blocks a $p$-label that corresponds to the relative order of the numbers in that block. For $L=263415$, we get the following:\n\n$$\n\\underline{263} 415 \\rightarrow 132 ; \\quad 2 \\underline{63415} \\rightarrow 312 ; \\quad 26 \\underline{341} 5 \\rightarrow 231 ; \\quad 263 \\underline{415} \\rightarrow 213\n$$\n\nMoving from left to right in the $n$-label, there are $n-p+1$ such blocks, which means we obtain an $(n-p+1)$-tuple of $p$-labels. For $L=263415$, we get the 4 -tuple $(132,312,231,213)$. We will call this $(n-p+1)$-tuple the $\\boldsymbol{p}$-signature of $L$ (or signature, if $p$ is clear from the context) and denote it by $S_{p}[L]$; the $p$-labels in the signature are called windows. For $L=263415$, the windows are $132,312,231$, and 213 , and we write\n\n$$\nS_{3}[263415]=(132,312,231,213)\n$$\n\nMore generally, we will call any $(n-p+1)$-tuple of $p$-labels a $p$-signature, even if we do not know of an $n$-label to which it corresponds (and even if no such label exists). A signature that occurs for exactly one $n$-label is called unique, and a signature that doesn't occur for any $n$-labels is called impossible. A possible signature is one that occurs for at least one $n$-label.\n\nIn this power question, you will be asked to analyze some of the properties of labels and signatures.\nCompute two other 6-labels with the same 4-signature as 462135."
